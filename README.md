# ImageSender is back to life !
After the changes that had broken the plugin I had decided, a year ago, not to continue the development of the plugin. However, I kept the idea of completely redoing it. Here we are, I did a complete rewrite of the plugin, theoretically less messy than before!

# What is that ?
ImageSender is a plugin that allows you to easily send images from a or mutilple folders on your computer. You can send memes and many other things more easily!

# Inspiration
The official inspiration comes from the ReactionImage plugin from Metalloriff. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/ReactionImages.plugin.js">here</a>. I created this plugin because his doesn't work for me. 

# Download
Download <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CriosChan/ImageSender/main/ImageSender.plugin.js">ImageSender</a> plugin using CTRL+S and <a href="https://rauenzi.github.io/BDPluginLibrary/release/0PluginLibrary.plugin.js">ZeresPluginLibrary</a> using CTRL+S too.
