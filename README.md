# ImageSender
ImageSender is a plugin that allows you to easily send images from a folder on your computer. You can send memes and many other things more easily! **For the moment in pre-alpha**

# Inspiration
The official inspiration comes from the ReactionImage plugin from Metalloriff. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/ReactionImages.plugin.js">here</a>. I created this plugin because his doesn't work for me.
